This project focuses on sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.
The goal is to automatically classify customer reviews as Positive (Liked = 1) or Negative (Liked = 0) based on the review text.

The dataset contains 1000 restaurant reviews, evenly balanced between positive and negative sentiments. Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing classifier.# Restaurant-Review
